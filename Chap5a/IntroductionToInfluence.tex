\section{Leverage and Influence}
\subsection{Influence}
The influence of an observation can be thought of in terms of how much the predicted scores for other observations would differ if the observation in question were not included. 

Cook's D is a good measure of the influence of an observation and is proportional to the sum of the squared differences between predictions made with all observations in the analysis and predictions made leaving out the observation in question. If the predictions are the same with or without the observation in question, then the observation has no influence on the regression model. If the predictions differ greatly when the observation is not included in the analysis, then the observation is influential.

\subsection{Interpreting Cook's Distance}
A common rule of thumb is that an observation with a value of Cook's D over 1.0 has too much influence. As with all rules of thumb, this rule should be applied judiciously and not thoughtlessly.

\subsection{Leverage}

% Leverage
The leverage of an observation is based on how much the observation's value on the predictor variable differs from the mean of the predictor variable. The greater an observation's leverage, the more potential it has to be an influential observation. 

For example, an observation with a value equal to the mean on the predictor variable has no influence on the slope of the regression line regardless of its value on the criterion variable. On the other hand, an observation that is extreme on the predictor variable has the potential to affect the slope greatly.

\subsubsection{Calculation of Leverage (h)}
The first step is to standardize the predictor variable so that it has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Then, the leverage (h) is computed by squaring the observation's value on the standardized predictor variable, adding 1, and dividing by the number of observations.


\subsection{Summary of Influence Statistics}
\begin{itemize}
\item	\textbf{Studentized Residuals} – Residuals divided by their estimated standard errors (like t-statistics). Observations with values larger than 3 in absolute value are considered outliers.
\item	\textbf{Leverage Values (Hat Diag)} – Measure of how far an observation is from the others in terms of the levels of the independent variables (not the dependent variable). Observations with values larger than $2(k+1)/n$ are considered to be potentially highly influential, where k is the number of predictors and n is the sample size.
\item	\textbf{DFFITS} – Measure of how much an observation has effected its fitted value from the regression model. Values larger than $2\sqrt{(k+1)/n}$ in absolute value are considered highly influential. %Use standardized DFFITS in SPSS.
\item	\textbf{DFBETAS} – Measure of how much an observation has effected the estimate of a regression coefficient (there is one DFBETA for each regression coefficient, including the intercept). Values larger than 2/sqrt(n) in absolute value are considered highly influential.
\\
The measure that measures how much impact each observation has on a particular predictor is DFBETAs The DFBETA for a predictor and for a particular observation is the difference between the regression coefficient calculated for all of the data and the regression coefficient calculated with the observation deleted, scaled by the standard error calculated with the observation deleted. 

\item	\textbf{Cook’s D} – Measure of aggregate impact of each observation on the group of regression coefficients, as well as the group of fitted values. Values larger than 4/n are considered highly influential.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{What is Influence} %1.1.5

Broadly defined, influence is understood as the ability of a single or multiple data points, through their presence or absence in the data, to alter important aspects of the analysis, yield qualitatively different inferences, or violate assumptions of the statistical model. The goal of influence analysis is not primarily to mark data
points for deletion so that a better model fit can be achieved for the reduced data, although this might be a result of influence analysis \citep{schabenberger}.

\subsection{Quantifying Influence}  %1.1.6

The basic procedure for quantifying influence is simple as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Fit the model to the data and obtain estimates of all parameters.
\item Remove one or more data points from the analysis and compute updated estimates of model parameters.
\item Based on full- and reduced-data estimates, contrast quantities of interest to determine how the absence of the observations changes the analysis.
\end{itemize}

\citet{cook86} introduces powerful tools for local-influence assessment and examining perturbations in the assumptions of a model. In particular the effect of local perturbations of parameters or observations are examined.
