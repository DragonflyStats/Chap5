 % Abstract for CPJ paper
 % Mixed linear models arise in many areas of application. 
 % Standard estimation methods for mixed models are sensitive to bizarre observations. 
 % Such influential observations can completely distort an analysis and lead to inappropriate actions and conclusions. 
 % We develop case-deletion diagnostics for detecting influential observations in mixed linear models. 
 % Diagnostics for both fixed effects and variance components are proposed. 
 % Computational formulas are given that make the procedures feasible. 
 % The methods are illustrated using examples.

\subsection{Case Deletion Diagnostics for Mixed Models}


\citet{Christiansen} notes the case deletion diagnostics techniques have not been applied to linear mixed effects 
models and seeks to develop methodologies in that respect.

For notational simplicity, $\boldsymbol{A}(i)$ denotes an $n \times m$ matrix $\boldsymbol{A}$ with the $i$-th row
removed, $a_i$ denotes the $i$-th row of $\boldsymbol{A}$, and $a_{ij}$ denotes the $(i, j)-$th element of $\boldsymbol{A}$.

Without loss of generality, matrices can be partitioned as if the $i-$th omitted observation is the first row; i.e. $i=1$.

\section{Case Deletion Diagnostics} %1.6

\citet{CPJ} develops \index{case deletion diagnostics} case deletion diagnostics, in particular the equivalent of \index{Cook's distance} Cook's distance, for diagnosing influential observations when estimating the fixed effect parameters and variance components.

\subsection{Deletion Diagnostics}

Since the pioneering work of Cook in 1977, deletion measures have been applied to many statistical models for identifying influential observations.

Deletion diagnostics provide a means of assessing the influence of an observation (or groups of observations) on inference on the estimated parameters of LME models.

Data from single individuals, or a small group of subjects may influence non-linear mixed effects model selection. Diagnostics routinely applied in model building may identify such individuals, but these methods are not specifically designed for that purpose and are, therefore, not optimal. We describe two likelihood-based diagnostics for identifying individuals that can influence the choice between two competing models.

Case-deletion diagnostics provide a useful tool for identifying influential observations and outliers.

The computation of case deletion diagnostics in the classical model is made simple by the fact that estimates of $\beta$ and $\sigma^2$, which exclude the ith observation, can be computed without re-fitting the model. Such update formulas are available in the mixed model only if you assume that the covariance parameters are not affected by the removal of the observation in question. This is rarely a reasonable assumption.

\section{Terminology for Case Deletion diagnostics} %1.8

\citet{preisser} describes two type of diagnostics. When the set consists of only one observation, the type is called
'observation-diagnostics'. For multiple observations, Preisser describes the diagnostics as 'cluster-deletion' diagnostics.
