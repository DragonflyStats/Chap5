 % Abstract for CPJ paper
 % Mixed linear models arise in many areas of application. 
 % Standard estimation methods for mixed models are sensitive to bizarre observations. 
 % Such influential observations can completely distort an analysis and lead to inappropriate actions and conclusions. 
 % We develop case-deletion diagnostics for detecting influential observations in mixed linear models. 
 % Diagnostics for both fixed effects and variance components are proposed. 
 % Computational formulas are given that make the procedures feasible. 
 % The methods are illustrated using examples.

\subsection{Case Deletion Diagnostics for Mixed Models}


\citet{Christiansen} notes the case deletion diagnostics techniques have not been applied to linear mixed effects 
models and seeks to develop methodologies in that respect.


\citet{Christiansen} develops these techniques in the context of REML
