	\section{Introduction}%1.1
	In classical linear models model diagnostics have been become a required part of any statistical analysis, and the methods are commonly available in statistical packages and standard textbooks on applied regression. However it has been noted by several papers that model diagnostics do not often accompany LME model analyses.
	Model diagnostic techniques determine whether or not the distributional assumptions are satisfied, and to assess the influence of unusual observations.
	
	\subsection{What is Influence} %1.1.5
	
	
	Broadly defined, influence is understood as the ability of a single or multiple data points, through their presence or absence in the data, to alter important aspects of the analysis, yield qualitatively different inferences, or violate assumptions of the statistical model. The goal of influence analysis is not primarily to mark data
	points for deletion so that a better model fit can be achieved for the reduced data, although this might be a result of influence analysis \citep{schabenberger}.

	\subsection{Quantifying Influence}  %1.1.6
	
	
	The basic procedure for quantifying influence is simple as follows:
	
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Fit the model to the data and obtain estimates of all parameters.
		\item Remove one or more data points from the analysis and compute updated estimates of model parameters.
		\item Based on full- and reduced-data estimates, contrast quantities of interest to determine how the absence of the observations changes the analysis.
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	\citet{cook86} introduces powerful tools for local-influence assessment and examining perturbations in the assumptions of a model. In particular the effect of local perturbations of parameters or observations are examined.
	
	
	
	
	

	
	\subsection{Model Data Agreement}
	Schabenberger(20XX) describes the examination of model-data agreement as comprising several elements; \begin{itemize}
	\item residual analysis, 
	\item goodness of fit, 
	\item collinearity diagnostics
	\item influence analysis.

\subsection{Residual diagnostics} %1.3
For classical linear models, residual diagnostics are typically implemented as a plot of the observed residuals and the predicted values. A visual inspection for the presence of trends inform the analyst on the validity of distributional assumptions, and to detect outliers and influential observations.

\newpage
\subsection*{Extension of techniques to LME Models} %1.2

Model diagnostic techniques, well established for classical models, have since been adapted for use with linear mixed effects models.Diagnostic techniques for LME models are inevitably more difficult to implement, due to the increased complexity.

% - \citet{Beckman}
Beckman, Nachtsheim and Cook (1987)  applied the \index{local influence}local influence method of Cook (1986) to the analysis of the linear mixed model.

While the concept of influence analysis is straightforward, implementation in mixed models is more complex. Update formulae for fixed effects models are available only when the covariance parameters are assumed to be known.

If the global measure suggests that the points in $U$ are influential, the nature of that influence should be determined. In particular, the points in $U$ can affect the following

\begin{itemize}
\item the estimates of fixed effects,
\item the estimates of the precision of the fixed effects,
\item the estimates of the covariance parameters,
\item the estimates of the precision of the covariance parameters,
\item fitted and predicted values.
\end{itemize}

Influence Diagnostics
Basic Idea and Statistics

The general idea of quantifying the influence of one or more observations relies on computing parameter estimates based on all data points, removing the cases in question from the data, refitting the model, and computing statistics based on the change between full-data and reduced-data estimation. 

Influence statistics can be coarsely grouped by the aspect of estimation that is their primary target:
\begin{itemize}
\item overall measures compare changes in objective functions: (restricted) likelihood distance (Cook and Weisberg 1982, Ch. 5.2)
\item influence on parameter estimates: Cookâ€™s  (Cook 1977, 1979), MDFFITS (Belsley, Kuh, and Welsch 1980, p. 32)
\item influence on precision of estimates: CovRatio and CovTrace
\item influence on fitted and predicted values: PRESS residual, PRESS statistic (Allen 1974), DFFITS (Belsley, Kuh, and Welsch 1980, p. 15)
\item outlier properties: internally and externally studentized residuals, leverage
\end{itemize}
For linear models for uncorrelated data, it is not necessary to refit the model after removing a data point in order to measure the impact of an observation on the model. The change in fixed effect estimates, residuals, residual sums of squares, and the variance-covariance matrix of the fixed effects can be computed based on the fit to the full data alone. By contrast, in mixed models several important complications arise. Data points can affect not only the fixed effects but also the covariance parameter estimates on which the fixed-effects estimates depend. 

Furthermore, closed-form expressions for computing the change in important model quantities might not be available.
This section provides background material for the various influence diagnostics available with the MIXED procedure. See the section Mixed Models Theory for relevant expressions and definitions. The parameter vector  denotes all unknown parameters in the  and  matrix.
The observations whose influence is being ascertained are represented by the set  and referred to simply as "the observations in ." The estimate of a parameter vector, such as , obtained from all observations except those in the set  is denoted . In case of a matrix , the notation  represents the matrix with the rows in  removed; these rows are collected in . If  is symmetric, then notation  implies removal of rows and columns. The vector  comprises the responses of the data points being removed, and  is the variance-covariance matrix of the remaining observations. When , lowercase notation emphasizes that single points are removed, such as .
